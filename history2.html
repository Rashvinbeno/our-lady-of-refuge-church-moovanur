    <h1> History of St. Mary"s Institutes</h1>
    <p>
      The primary school was established on 19th October 1953 and was later upgraded to a Middle School on 2nd June 1999. From its inception, the school has consistently maintained a high standard of education and has attracted an increasing number of students. Initially, Mr. Iruthaya Samy served as the headmaster, laying a strong foundation for the institution. Following his tenure, Sr. Iruthaya Mary MA, B.Ed took over as the headmaster, continuing the legacy of excellence and dedication to the students' holistic development. Over the years, the school’s infrastructure and educational quality have steadily improved, thanks to ongoing efforts by the management and staff. Modern classrooms, well-equipped laboratories, and a library with a vast collection of books have been added to support students' academic growth. The institution is committed to providing a well-rounded education, which includes not only academic excellence but also personal development. Various extracurricular activities such as yoga, meditation, art and crafts, sports, and cultural festivals are an integral part of the school curriculum. These activities are designed to encourage creativity, teamwork, discipline, and physical fitness. The school also organizes events that bring the community together, fostering a strong sense of unity and cultural appreciation. Additionally, the school places a strong emphasis on science education, offering state-of-the-art laboratories and interactive learning resources. Resources like growing materials for practical science projects encourage students to explore the natural world, engage in problem-solving, and develop a passion for learning. The school continuously strives to inspire curiosity, innovation, and a love for learning among its students. The school’s long-standing tradition of excellence in education, paired with its modern approach, ensures that students are well-prepared for their future academic and personal endeavors. </p>
